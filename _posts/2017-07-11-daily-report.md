Any contacts?

Remember that a ''good participant'' is someone who kept their head still and firmly against the faceplate for the full duration of the session (from when the ''Experiment On!'' light went on all the way until it goes off). I'll bring the clickers to Brighton tomorrow (today, aka Wednesday) for counting ''good'' participants.

Also, you should have recieved an invitation to view a google calendar called ''Surprising Minds exhibit hosting''. Everything on there should be as we discussed. I did go ahead and schedule the last week of your placement -- take a look and let me know as soon as possible if any new conflicts arise.

Lastly, here's a [video](https://youtu.be/icP0vaKZ6OE) with some background on the experiment -- very similar to the presentation video I sent you over whatsapp, but better quality and meant for a general audience (that presentation was at a cephalopod research conference).

Ok, that's all for now. Great job hosting the exhibit today!
