Brief description of the day: Today I was in from 9-12:40 (I closed the exhibit at 12:30) because I had to go to work but I managed to get 55 good participants. I didn't take lunch today because of the early closing factor. I was asked a lot about the science behind it; a lot of parents seemed really interested in understanding why and how the process is done. I also got a lot of questions about the cuttlefish from two kids around the age of 10; overall there was a lot of interest in the "why?" of the experiment, even the foreign students asked me about it.

I've found that the wipes work well on keeping the exhibit clean and I do clean it at the end of when I host. 

Best comment: I think the best comment today was when a really young boy, before I could answer the dad, said "that's a horseshoe crab dad, they're very prehistoric." Which I found very impressive and very cute.
