Brief description of the day: many many families! used a nice strategy that reanna taught me, to tell the littlest kids that they can watch their parents/grandparents' eyes, and this got more adults to participate in the exhibit. I also started describing the exhibit as "this is an interactive science exhibit, where we show you a 30-second video clip about the ocean while we video record your eyes, close up. afterwards, we'll replay that video for you so that you can see what your eyes do when you watch movies!" that seemed to work really well. 

Best comment: met a psychologist who told me, "your experiment is way more fun than any other behaviour study I've done!"
