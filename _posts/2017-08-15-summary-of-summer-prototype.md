Hope you're all having a lovely summer!

I just wanted to share some numbers and impressions regarding the exhibit and what Reanna, our Nuffield placement student, was up to over the summer. First and foremost, I'd like to thank everyone for contributing to this enormous effort, and congratulate us all on such a successful prototyping phase!

Below is a brief summary of what happened with the exhibit over the summer.

Since the start of Reanna's placement on Monday, 10th July 2017 until the end of her placement on Sunday, 13th of August:

 - the exhibit ran for 22 days, 16 of which were hosted by Reanna.

 - during those 22 days, an estimated **1978 people participated** in prototyping our crowd neuroscience eye-tracking system (an average of ~90 "good participants" per day).

 - according to our estimates, the exhibit was most popular on Saturdays and least popular on Sundays, with averages of 93.6667 and 63.5 good participants, respectively.

A full breakdown of the numbers can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tj5ZAFOglBrkpkinGc_EcrFdYf5OIS3mkSQy8KW37xM/edit?usp=sharing).

Our project hashtags for photos and videos of the exhibit (#SurprisingMinds and #EveryMindOnline) didn't get much traffic over the last three weeks, but we hope to get more contributions as we move forward. 

Once again, many many thanks to Reanna for a wonderful job as our summer host, and to everyone who put in so much time and effort to make this exhibit happen. I'm super excited to see what we can make of this dataset!
