The following is the transcript of an email I sent on July 2, 2017: 

Hi everyone,

Just wanted to update everyone on the progress made with the Sea Life Brighton interactive display unit.

All of the software logic to trigger the visual stimuli, record from the eye cameras, and then play the recorded video of the eye on a feedback screen are completed. The only major thing left to build and test is the "person detection" circuit, aka the mechanism of starting the experiment when people press their foreheads against the face plate. Other than that, the only thing left is to tweak hardware placement/organisation/make it all look pretty on Monday.

Clive, I think we have a feasible but long list of things to do on Monday before you arrive. I don't think we'll be ready for you before 6pm -- how late in the evening can you pick up the unit?

Below is the "Surprise! Intelligence" (newly coined exhibit name) to do list. Please give it a look over, and let me know if you think I've missed anything.

TO DO BY END OF MONDAY (Clive takes unit from SWC)  
 - affix eye camera holders to acrylic face plate:  
-- drill holes into the acrylic face plate  
-- screw + nut to keep camera holders in place  
 - figure out how to fix eye cameras in place but allow easy adjustment (we will try sewing pins!)  
 - build person-detection systems:  
-- add foam mask lining to front of face plate  
-- create copper tape open circuit between layers of foam  
-- hide arduino in middle shelf  
-- troubleshoot  
(-- backup detector: LDR above nose hole)  
 - feedback projection:  
-- diffusers on side domes  
-- color changing lights in domes without feedback screens  
 - "Experiment On!" sign for top dome  
-- need to control an LED via exhibit workflow, so that it turns on when stimuli start to play  
-- stencil and spray paint words onto acrylic plate provided by Sol Vin  
 - organize cables  
 - replace all blue tac  
 - get a wireless dongle for the NUC and install TeamViewer for remote access to NUC  

WHEN CLIVE ARRIVES TO PICK UP UNIT  
 - remove all hardware inside unit that could be damaged by transport  

TO DO ON TUESDAY BEFORE ONSITE INSTALLATION  
 - finalize content for visual stimulation  
 - finalize script/format for interaction as "resident scientist host"  
 - finalize content of project page on everymind.online  
 - confirm timeline for exhibit posters (on wall behind interactive unit)

TO DO DURING ON SITE INSTALLATION  
 - face plate holder should allow easy replacement of face plate while keeping faceplate from popping in when ppl press heads against viewing hole (Clive and Hazel, how do you plan to affix face plate?)  
 - black fabric and thumbtacks to hide wires in top shelf compartment  
 - drill holes for access to power source  
 - possibly drill holes for easy access to turn on/off large monitor  
 - need to store wireless keyboard, mouse, and extra cameras on-site  

TO DO ON LIVE DAY 1 (WEDNESDAY)  
 - Kampff lab spends the day at Sea Life Brighton to troubleshoot the interactive unit on it's first day of use by Sea Life guests.  
 - I'll explain the exhibit and the interactive unit at Sea Life Brighton morning staff meeting

Thank you everyone for the tremendous work you've put in to make this exhibit a reality!! Please let me know if you have any additional concerns or questions as we move towards the exhibit's grand opening. Enjoy the rest of your weekend!

Cheers,  
Danbee
