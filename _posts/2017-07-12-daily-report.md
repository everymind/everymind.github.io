Breif descritopn of the day: The morning was less successful than the afternoon, mostly due to the large numbers of primary school children that wanted to take part. They were often just too small to reach the eye piece, so the footage was not satisfactory because their eye was often not in view. In addition, did not help that there was few teachers with them. There were also a few very disruptive children who would distract the child taking part in the exhibit. Furthermore, a main issue was the teachers themselves who would not be present when I told the children the instructions and would then try and get the child away for other children to have a go, not knowing that they had to stay there. This was usually because they were rushing to see a tour.

The afternoon was better, because there were mostly families and older students and generally fewer guests. However, there was a couple of groups where there was quite a large language barrier, which made the communication of instructions difficult, but I managed to find one person in the group who had good English to communicate the information to the rest of the group. In addition, a couple of the teenagers had a habit of getting their phones out to film the video when they either did not understand or did not listen to my instructions. But overall the afternoon was successful. 

Best comment: 'why is the fish in the tank to the left trying to breath out of water' (3 people asked about the weird fish in the tank next to us that likes to swim vertically with its mouth out of water. It seemed that the horseshoe carb did not get as much attention today)
