Brief description of the day: The morning was quite busy, and today we had many visitors who, without prompt, reported an interesting array of conditions -- dyslexia, one eye has no sight, "funny eyes", lazy eyes. I had a long conversation with one woman about how we are analyzing the eye videos without having collected any additional context (pre-existing medical conditions, profession, hobbies, life experience) mostly to annonymize participants at this stage. In future studies we do plan to use surveys and questionnaires to collect additional data from our participants, but how to make this robust and anonymous...interesting questions for the future. 

Best comment: "Look, it's nan's funny eye!" peals of young laughter follow.
