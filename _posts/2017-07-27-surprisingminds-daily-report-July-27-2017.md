Brief description of the day: The day had quite a slow start but by the afternoon it was very busy. I had a lot of keen younger children today spanning from 10-14 who were all very excited to take part. I also met a young adult lady who is currently doing her own dissertation in the field of neuroscience and psychology by presenting a hypothesis related to touch; she was very keen to discuss the experiment with me. The new posters had been installed for today and they incorporate the experiment well and are visually very appealing.
