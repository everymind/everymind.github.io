Brief description of the day: The day was quite busy, there were a few foreign schools and a lot of families with kids. A lot of older people took a shining to the exhibit and I think telling them it is a science experiment really gives a unique gratification to participating. It was very interesting to see how many people enjoyed knowing the neuroscience context and one of the men that participated said he'd visit the website.

I seem to have noticed (after reading the Neuroscience Needs Behaviour paper) that asking for professions from adults is quite easy and that I managed to guess an ex Marine because of his sporadic eye movements followed by intense focus (this could just be a coincidence but I thought it was very interesting).
