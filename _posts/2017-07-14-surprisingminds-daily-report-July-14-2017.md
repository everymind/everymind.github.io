Host: Reanna  

Day start: 09h50   
Lunch break start: 12h50  
Lunch break end: 13h40  
Day end: 16h45  

\# of "good" participants: 125  
Estimated average age group: ~10 or 45+  

Brief description of the day: Today it was just me hosting the exhibit, it was open and ready before any guests arrived and I took lunch around 12:50 but came back ten minutes early because I really wanted to reach the daily goal. There were 125 good participants, either aged around 10 or 45+.

One of the ladies I spoke to lectured in neuroscience and was incredibly interested by the project. Another encounter I had was when an older couple came up to me and started discussing the science with me (it was the man's birthday too).

I came across the fact that the mask does not stick out as much and that makes it a little more difficult to take off the cover (this is more of a nitpick comment, it isn't a massive issue). 

Best comment: "(in a really thick Italian accent, whilst watching the octopus part of the stimuli) holy fuck is that a squid!"
