Brief description of the day: It was pretty slow all day, but this meant I got more time with each participant. Developed a good flow of explaining what the exhibit does, then as they watch the replay, explained to participants that "this is part of a larger effort to bring neuroscience out of the lab and 'into the wild', so to speak. we plan to validate results from classic eye-tracking experiments, which typically studied around 10-50 people per experiment. Here at Sea Life Brighton, we get 50-100 people using our exhibit every day, so we want to know if the traditional results still hold up after sampling a much larger portion of humanity." or something like that :) Many people took pictures today, and so I was able to encourage them to use our hashtags -- the teenagers were especially quick to catch on, at least in the moment, to how to do this, so let's see if our hashtags get more activity in the coming days.

Best comment: "What's that?" "That's daddy's eye!" "Aaaaaaaaaahcreepy!!!!"
