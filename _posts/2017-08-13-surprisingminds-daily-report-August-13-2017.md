Brief description of the day: The day was very slow, especially for a Sunday, with most of the patrons being families with very small children so they could not participate for fear of the children running away or not being able to focus for too long. Nevertheless, we were still able to procure a few parents for the exhibit and a few excitable children. The day was quite good, an average amount of good data was collected.
