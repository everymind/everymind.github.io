Brief description of the day: There were less schools in today, but a lot more families consisting of young children. If the children were too young I encouraged the adults to try the exhibit so that the children could watch; this seemed to be a very good way of going about it. A lot of people, again, were interested in the science behind the exhibit and I was asked frequently to explain why we were doing it. Overall, there was a steady stream of participants all the way through my shift.

Best comment: (when I explained it was a science experiment and we were looking to get a lot of data to a lady) "oh well all of us (her family) will do it then!"
