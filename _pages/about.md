## Finding Patterns in Chaos

We started as a neuroscience lab, studying "intelligent systems". But the more we probed this idea of intelligent systems, the more we wondered, "What is intelligence anyway?" and "Why do we even have a cortex?"

We chewed on these deep philosophical questions while helping build better tools for neuroscience -- namely, [Bonsai](https://bitbucket.org/horizongir/bonsai), a visual programming language for processing dynamic datastreams, and [Neuroseeker](http://neuroseeker.eu/), a micro-fabrication process for building silicon probes with recording sites all along its shaft. These tools have allowed us to run experiments with freely behaving subjects in dynamic, enriched environments and to record neural activity from many parts of the brain at the same time. 

But the data we collected using these tools have overwhelmed our ability to analyze and synthesize. Digesting these datasets will require many people, not just to involve a variety of skills and perspectives, but also because the datasets are so large that we simply don't have time to tackle them with the traditional 3 or 4 person team. Computers cannot automate our work, because currently even our most sophisticated AI cannot work faster than a human on figuring out new processes -- they really only excel when the problem or task is clearly defined. 

**Luckily, humans excel at "just figuring out" poorly defined problems, primarily thanks to our incredible ability to find patterns.** So we've decided to involve more humans in our neuroscience process. 

## More Brains Studying Brains

Neuroscience is a huge field. People study everything from cellular mechanisms to whole organism behavior, from millisecond changes to evolutionary adaptations, from electrical signals to chemical cascades. There are so many measurements being made of the brain, and yet we still understand so little about how these molecular and cellular interactions become emotions and thoughts and behaviors. 

At the same time, every living human has a brain and uses it -- *all* of it -- every day. We have all been running "neuroscience experiments" our whole lives, from when we first figured out how to walk on two legs to earlier today when we navigated our way through morning traffic. Our movements and our habits reflect how we understand the world and how we learn. 

**We think that this experiential knowledge is crucial to our understanding of brains and minds.** Part of involving more humans in our neuroscience process is about sharing our experiences as brain-users, and creating a shared vocabulary to discuss these qualitative, hard-to-measure things about living with a nervous system. 

## From the Father of Cybernetics

"Since Leibniz there has perhaps been no man who has had a full command of all the intellectual activity of his day. Since that time, science has been increasingly the task of specialists, in fields which show a tendency to grow progressively narrower... Today there are few scholars who can call themselves mathematicians or physicists or biologists without restriction. A man may be a topologist or a coleopterist. He will be filled with the jargon of his field, and will know all its literature and all its ramifications, but, more frequently than not, he will regard the next subject as something belonging to his colleague three doors down the corridor, and will consider any interest in it on his own part as an unwarrantable breach of privacy... There are fields of scientific work, as we shall see in the body of this book, which have been explored from the different sides of pure mathematics, statistics, electrical engineering, and neurophysiology; in which every single notion receives a separate name from each group, and in which important work has been triplicated or quadruplicated, while still other important work is delayed by the unavailability in one field of results that may have already become classical in the next field.

**It is these boundary regions which offer the richest opportunities to the qualified investigator.** They are at the same time the most refractory to the accepted techniques of mass attack and the division of labor. If the difficulty of a physiological problem is mathematical in essence, then physiologists ignorant of mathematics will get precisely as far as one physiologists ignorant of mathematics, and no further. If a physiologist who knows no mathematics works together with a mathematician who knows no physiology, the one will be unable to state his problem in terms that the other can manipulate, and the second will be unable to put the answers in any form that the first can understand... **A proper exploration of these blank spaces on the map of science could only be made by a team of scientists, each a specialist in his own field but each possessing a thoroughly sound and trained acquaintance with the fields of his neighbors; all in the habit of working together, of knowing one another's intellectual customs, and of recognizing the significance e of a colleague's new suggestion before it has taken on a full formal expression.** The mathematician need not have the skill to conduct a physiological experiment, but he must have the skill to understand one, to criticize one, and to suggest one. The physiologist need not be able to prove a certain mathematical theorem, but he must be able to grasp its physiological significance and to tell the mathematician for what he should look. **We had dreamed for years of an institution of independent scientists, working together in one of these backwoods of science, not as subordinates of some great executive officer, but joined by the desire, indeed by the spiritual necessity, to understand the region as a whole, and to lend one another the strength of that understanding.**"

-Norbert Weiner, *Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine*, 1948.
