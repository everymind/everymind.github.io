During the summer of 2017, Sea Life Brighton will host an interactive science exhibit that protoypes a new way to ask scientific questions about behaviour and the mind "in the wild"! 

## How do you participate?

Watch a 30-second video for science! While you watch, we'll video record your eyes, then replay the recording so that you can see what your eyes do when you watch movies, or look at the world!

## How does this help neuroscience?

Traditional science experiments studying human behaviour are most often conducted inside laboratories with 10 to 50 participants, and then generalized to conclude something about the behaviour of all humans. We believe that such small datasets run a great risk of misleading our understanding of human behaviour.

So, we want to bring these studies of behaviour out of the laboratory and "into the wild"! For humans, this means bringing our experiments to places like the Sea Life center, where 50 to 100 people per day can participate in our studies, discuss our hypotheses and results, and learn about cutting edge ideas and technologies for understanding minds.
