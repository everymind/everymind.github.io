## What do we mean by "intelligent behaviour"?

We believe that _intelligent behaviour_ has to do with how you create and play with your expectations about the world around you in order to solve problems. We also believe that there is a difference between the kind of _intelligence_ that is relevant for humans in industrialised societies, and the abstract characteristics that define the general idea of _intelligence_, which should apply no matter the context or who is using it. 

This belief is strengthened by the fact that cephalopods, marine animals whose nervous systems are completely different from ours, are able to solve many problems that we once thought only humans could solve. So we want to design experiments that can pose problems to both humans and cuttlefish in more or less the same way, without relying on human language. In this way, we can compare the solutions given by humans versus cuttlefish. If a certain strategy or mental tool for problem-solving is important for **both** species, it's likely that such a strategy or tool may be a **general principle** of _intelligence_. 

## A history of "intelligence": test scores vs. "power" and learning

Often _intelligence_ is used to describe how well we do on tests (sometimes called the "psychometric view"). This assumes that the way we think can be measured by how well we do on tests. Because we believe this, we now have a lot of data on humans solving many different kinds of problems. Many scientists have now analysed over 60 years of test scores, at different times and with different methods. They all realised that people who do well on tests in general also tend to score well on three types of tests:
 
  1. "Fluid intelligence", or figuring out solutions to new and unusual problems;
  2. "Crystallised intelligence", or using what one already know from past experience to solve a problem; and
  3. "Visual-spatial reasoning", or being able to use visual images and relationships to solve problems.
 
If _intelligence_ is a single thing that can be measured and improved on (sometimes called "general intelligence"), then anything that changes a person's score on one type of test should have a similar effect on any of the other two types. But it turns out that this is not true. Take aging, for example. **On average**, test scores in "fluid intelligence" tend to decrease as a person gets older, while **on average**, test scores in "crystallised intelligence" tend to stay the same or even increase. So while test scores might tell you who could learn a job faster or more easily, test scores can't tell you how well a person will perform once they've learned the job.
 
This means that differences in test scores do not capture everything we want to know about the differences in the ways that we think. So scientists came up with another way to think about _intelligence_, based on more general ideas about the nature of thinking (sometimes called the "cognitive-psychology view"). This point of view assumes that thinking is the process of:
 
  1. creating a mental structure that represents the current problem in your head,
  2. remembering information that seems relevant, and
  3. playing with the representation in your head in order to find a solution.
 
If thinking is a process, then _intelligence_ can be described as a combination of several things. One of them is a person's "power" for thinking, or how well they can use the thinking process described above. The others are learning and experience, which provide knowledge of how to use one's thinking power and access to useful information. This means that if you are facing a 
new kind of problem, finding a solution depends on your ability to create new representations in your head. As you learn and gain experience, finding solutions effectively depends on recognising patterns between past solutions and the current problem. 

While this viewpoint makes _intelligence_ harder to summarise with numbers, it does a better job of explaining the differences in the ways that humans think.
 
## Why does it matter?
 
The concept of _intelligence_ is actually quite political, especially when trying to explain its scientific underpinnings. 
 
Even though the scientific community has shown that test scores don't explain how different ways of thinking affect everyday performance, it's easy to use standardised tests to place people in schools and in jobs. This means that the education and economic opportunities available to a person are often determined by outdated and biased measures, in large part because the scientific community has not yet validated a new way to understand differences in the ways we think. 

And no matter how we measure these differences, it's clear that the increasingly technological nature of our lives have increased the rewards for those who can exploit technology while at the same time increasing the punishment for those who can't, meaning that the policies that dictate how to allocate education and economic opportunities have profound effects on people's lives. This means that progress in our scientific understanding of _intelligence_ and its characterisation is an important part of building a future that welcomes and respects everyone.
