During the summer of 2017, the Brighton Sea Life Center will host an interactive citizen science exhibit that engages Sea Life guests with current research about intelligent behavior across animal species. 

## What is 'intelligence', and how can we study it?

We believe that 'intelligence' has to do with how you respond when you are surprised, or how you respond to something you did not expect.

In order to be surprised, you have to be able to guess what is going to happen next, and you also have to decide how sure you are about your guess. When your guess is really wrong, but you felt very sure that you would be right, this moment is surprise, and it is in this moment that your understanding of the world breaks.


When you are able to deal with the thing that surprised you, to the point where maybe it doesn't surprise you any longer, you have changed your understanding of the world. Changing yourself in this way is an important part of learning how to learn, and we believe that learning how to learn is an important part of 'intelligence'.
