During the summer of 2017, the Brighton Sea Life Center will host an interactive citizen science exhibit that engages Sea Life guests with current neuroscience research trying to understand general principles of "intelligent behavior" by comparing the nervous systems of many different animal species. 

## What do we mean by "intelligent behavior"?

We believe that "intelligent behavior" has to do with how you respond when you are surprised, or how you respond to something you did not expect.

In order to be surprised, you have to be able to guess what is going to happen next, and you also have to decide how sure you are about your guess. When your guess is really wrong, but you felt very sure that you would be right, this moment is surprise, and it is in this moment that your understanding of the world breaks.

When you are able to deal with the thing that surprised you, to the point where maybe it doesn't surprise you any longer, you have changed your understanding of the world. Changing yourself in this way is an important part of learning how to learn, and we believe that learning how to learn is an important part of "intelligence". 

## A history of "intelligence": test scores vs. "power" and learning

Often "intelligence" is used to describe how well we do on tests (sometimes called the "psychometric view"). This assumes that the way we think can be measured by how well we do on tests. Because we believe this, we now have a lot of data on humans solving many different kinds of problems. Many scientists have now analysed over 60 years of test scores, at different times and with different methods. They all realized that people who do well on tests in general also tend to score well on three types of tests:
 
  1. "Fluid intelligence", or figuring out solutions to new and unusual problems;
  2. "Crystallized intelligence", or using what one already know from past experience to solve a problem; and
  3. "Visual-spatial reasoning", or being able to visualize and play with a problem in your head.
 
If "intelligence" is a single thing that a person can become very good at (sometimes called "general intelligence"), then anything that changes a person's score on one type of test should have a similar effect on any of the other two types. But it turns out that this is not true. Take aging, for example. Test scores in "fluid intelligence" tend to decrease as a person gets older, while test scores in "crystallized intelligence" tend to stay the same or even increase. So while test scores might tell you who can learn a job faster or more easily, it doesn't tell you how well a person will perform once they've learned the job.
 
This means that differences in test scores do not help explain differences in the ways that we think. So scientists came up with another way to think about "intelligence", based on more general ideas about the nature of thinking (sometimes called the "cognitive-psychology view"). This point of view assumes that thinking is the process of:
 
  1. visualizing the current problem in your head,
  2. remembering information that seems relevant, and
  3. playing with the visualization in your head in order to solve the problem.
 
If thinking is a process, then "intelligence" can be described as a combination of a person's "power" for thinking, plus learning and experience, which provide knowledge of how to use one's "power" and access to useful information. This means that if you are facing a new kind of problem, finding a solution depends on your ability to create new visualisations in your head. As you gain learning and experience, finding solutions effectively depends on recognising patterns between past solutions and the current problem. While this viewpoint makes "intelligence" harder to summarise with numbers, it does a better job of explaining the differences in the ways that humans think.
 
## Why does it matter?
 
Even though we know test scores don't explain how different ways of thinking affect everyday performance, test scores continue to be used to determine the education and job opportunities available to a person. And regardless of how we measure differences in "intelligence", it's clear that the increasingly technological nature of our lives have increased the rewards for the capable while at the same time increasing the punishment for those who can't keep up. So in an industrialized society, where economic roles dominate, extended family live scattered far from each other, and those with social power can afford to ignore those without social power, how we deal with differences in "intelligence" has a profound effect on people's lives. 


## How can we study it?

When we want to find out how brains understand the world, how can we study it?

We know that when we look at things, like this cup of water, we know what to do with them. We can imagine picking them up, throwing them around, what they feel like, and what they sound like. One way to study something is to try and build it. As of right now, we do not know how to give this power to imagine to things that we make.
 
We will try to understand this power by tracking people's eyes while they watch short movies (about 1 minute total) of surprising things happening. We use our eyes a lot to learn about the world around us, so tracking where people look can help us understand what they know and what they expect.

For each person who helps us in this study, we will save a set of movies -- one movie of each eye, and a movie showing where those eyes were looking when surprising things were happening. These movies will be anonymized and shared here, so that anyone interested in analyzing these movies can do so.  
 
## Why are cuttlefish involved?
 
The animals we usually study in neuroscience keep their brains hidden deep inside of their bodies, and so it's very hard to watch the brain while it is working inside of a moving animal. But this is slightly less true about cuttlefish. Instead of packing most (80-90%) of their nervous cells into a brain the way humans do, most (over 60%) of the cuttlefish nervous cells are out in the body.
 
Cuttlefish neurons control special cells in the skin that can change the cuttlefish's form, color and feel. One type of special cell is called a "chromatophore" - it's like a tiny bag full of color, with muscles holding onto it on all sides. Each muscle has 3 or 4 neurons wrapped around it. When the muscles are relaxed, the bag of color is closed tight and can't be seen; but when the neurons tell the muscles to pull, the bag of color can grow up to five times larger, making the skin in that area change color.
 
The cuttlefish's skin has over 20 million chromatophores, each controlled by twenty or more neurons. This means that over a hundred million neurons are working together to control how a cuttlefish appears to other animals. Given that, we believe that looking carefully at cuttlefish skin while it moves through the world could be a way to watch both single neurons and large groups of neurons at the same time without cutting open any part of the animal.
