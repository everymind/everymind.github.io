## How can we study "intelligence"?

When we want to find out how brains understand the world, how can we study it?

When we encounter familiar objects, like a cup of water, we know what to expect from them. We can imagine picking them up, throwing them around, what they feel like, and what they sound like. One way to study something is to try and build it. As of right now, we do not know how to give this power to imagine to things that we make.
 
We will try to understand this power by tracking people's eyes while they watch short movies of surprising or unexpected things happening. In order to be surprised, you have to be able to guess what is going to happen next, and you also have to decide how sure you are about your guess. When your guess is really wrong, but you felt very sure that you would be right, this moment is surprise, and it is in this moment that your understanding of the world breaks. We use our eyes a lot to learn about the world around us, so tracking where people look can help us understand what they expect. 

For each person who helps us in this study, we will save a set of movies -- one movie of each eye, and a movie showing where those eyes were looking when surprising things were happening. These movies will be anonymised and shared here, so that anyone interested in analysing these movies can do so. 

Tracking the movements of the eyes is just one way to study minds non-invasively. There are many aspects of behaviour that can clue us in to a person's expectations about the world around them, as long as we can recognize the moment of surprise. When surprise goes away, this means that you've figured out how to deal with the thing that surprised you, and you've changed your understanding of the world. Changing yourself in this way is an important part of learning how to learn, and we believe that learning how to learn is an important part of _intelligence_. 
 
## Why are cuttlefish involved?
 
The animals we usually study in neuroscience keep their brains hidden deep inside of their bodies, and so it's very hard to watch the brain while it is working inside of a moving animal. But this is slightly less true about cuttlefish. Instead of packing most (80-90%) of their nervous cells into a brain the way humans do, most (over 60%) of the cuttlefish nervous cells are out in the body.
 
Cuttlefish neurons control special cells in the skin that can change the cuttlefish's form, color and feel. One type of special cell is called a "chromatophore" - it's like a tiny bag full of color, with muscles holding onto it on all sides. Each muscle has 3 or 4 neurons wrapped around it. When the muscles are relaxed, the bag of color is closed tight and can't be seen; but when the neurons tell the muscles to pull, the bag of color can grow up to five times larger, making the skin in that area change color.
 
The cuttlefish's skin has over 20 million chromatophores, each controlled by twenty or more neurons. This means that over a hundred million neurons are working together to control how a cuttlefish appears to other animals. Given that, we believe that looking carefully at cuttlefish skin while it moves through the world could be a way to watch both single neurons and large groups of neurons at the same time without cutting open any part of the animal.
